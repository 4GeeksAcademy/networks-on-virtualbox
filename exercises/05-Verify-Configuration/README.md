# `05` Validate your installation

We have developed two scripts to help you measure your success during this project. 

Two scripts inside the `.learn/assets` folder are in charge of taking the information from VirtualBox back to LearnPack for validation. 

- `report_linux.sh` will be run automatically by learnpack.
- `report_windows.bat` you must copy and paste this file into your Windows virtual machine, run the file, and then copy the "windows_report.txt" file it generates and paste it into the root of these learnpack exercises for validation.

## 3. Running the test

Once you have pasted the windows_report.txt into the root of the LearnPack exercises, you can run the test to validate your Linux and Windows installation in VirtualBox.

## 4. Done!

If you passed the tests, you have already installed a virtual machine with Windows. This will be your safe place to do experiments and tests during the course.

If you have any problems, do not hesitate to contact a mentor or the other support channels offered by 4Geeks.
