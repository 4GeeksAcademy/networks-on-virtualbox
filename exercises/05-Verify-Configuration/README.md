# `05` Validate your installation

We have developed two scripts to help you measure your success during this project. 

There are two scripts inside the `./assets` folder there are in charge of taking the information from VirtualBox back to LearnPack for the validation. 

- `report_linux.sh` will be runned automatically by learnpack.
- `report_windows.bat` you have to copy and past into your windows computer, then you have to copy the "windows_report.txt" file it genrates and past it into the root of these exercises for validation.

## 3. Running the test

Once you have pasted the windows_report.txt into the root of the LearnPack exercises, you will be able to run the test to validate your Linux and Windows installation in VirtualBox.

## 4. Done!

If you passed the tests, you have already installed a virtual machine with windows. This will be your safe place to do experiments and tests during the course.

If you have any problems do not hesitate to contact a mentor or the other support channels offered by 4Geeks.
