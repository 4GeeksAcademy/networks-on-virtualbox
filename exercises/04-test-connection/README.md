# `03` Installation of virtual machines

In this practice you will learn how to create a virtual machine with VirtualBox, and then install an operating system on it. These machines will be your laboratory throughout the course, in them you will be able to explore safely without affecting your machine's own operating system. The worst that can happen is that you will have to install the virtual machine again, but your computer will be safe.

## 1. Create a new virtual machine

When you open VirtualBox you will see the "Add" icon marked with a green cross.

## 2. Enter a name for your machine and an operating system.

In the "ISO Image" list you should select the "Other" option and add the file you created in the previous step.

## 3. Unattended installation

In this step you can customize settings of the machine you are creating that will be applied automatically during the installation, so that the installation process will not be interrupted. At the end of the process you will have to choose a couple of privacy options, but the hard work is done.

## 3. Hardware Configuration

This is where you choose how much memory and processor your machine will have. It is important to allocate what is necessary for optimal operation, without compromising the host machine's own performance.

>You must allocate at least 2 cpus and 2 GB of memory to the machine.
