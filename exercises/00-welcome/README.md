# Configuring Interfaces in VirtualBox

For this practice, we will work with two virtual machines that you need to install if you haven't done so during previous exercises:

- A virtual machine with Debian ([you can download the image file here](https://storage.googleapis.com/breathecode/virtualbox/deb.ova)).
- Another [virtual machine with Windows](https://4geeks.com/interactive-exercise/installing-windows-on-virtual-machine).

You will configure a private network between the virtual machines with translation to the host network, known as a "NAT network."

The steps to follow in this practice are:

1. Import the Debian virtual machine
2. Create a NAT network
3. Configure interfaces on the virtual machines
4. Connection tests
5. Installation verification
