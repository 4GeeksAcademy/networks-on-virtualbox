# Setting up interfaces on VirtualBox

For this practice we will work with 2 virtual machines, one with Debian, and another with Windows. You will setup a private network between virtual machines with translation to the host network, in what is known as a “NAT network”.

The following steps in this practice are

1. Import the Debian virtual machine
2. Creating a NAT network
3. Configuring interfaces in the virtual machines
4. Connection tests
5. Verification of the installation
