For this project, you must import a virtual machine we have prepared. It comes with Debian installed and some basic settings that will be used during the bootcamp. Otherwise, it is a regular Debian machine like any other, and it will be an important space where you'll learn how to use GNU/Linux systems in a secure way for its use in network environments as a server.

[Download here the OVA file](https://storage.googleapis.com/breathecode/virtualbox/deb.ova) the file that you must import to VirtualBox to create de Debian virtual machine. It is a heavy file, so it is advisable to download it in advance to save time when doing the practice.

To login into the debian computer:

> **User**: `deb`  
> **Passworde**: `123456`  
> **Root password**: `123456`
